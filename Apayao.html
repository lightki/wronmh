			<h1>Apayao</h1>
		<div class="text">
		  <h3>I. Geography</h3>		
			<p>Apayao is located deep in the Cordillera mountains of Northern Luzon.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>These mountain ranges form a natural boundary between the Ilocos Region in the west and the Cagayan Valley in the east. It is covered with wide tracts of flatlands and floodplains among its main rivers, namely Abulug, Talibago, Matalak, and Sinundungan.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The province covers an area of 4,413.35 square kilometres and is subdivided into seven (7) municipalities, namely, Calanasan (Bayag), Conner, Flora, Luna, Pudtol, Sta. Marcela and Kabugao, the provincial capital. The municipality of Calanasan occupies the largest land area, some 1,256.2 sq. km., while Sta. Marcela occupies the smallest area, only 240.1 sq. km.&nbsp;</p>
		  <br><br>

			<h3>II. Economy</h3>
			<p>Apayao is largely an agricultural area. The primary products are rice, corn, coffee, and root crops such as sweet potato, yam, and taro. Fruits produced include lanzones, citrus, bananas and pineapples, durian, santol, rambutan, coconut, and mangosteen Rice production totaled 98,489 metric tons in 2011. Parts of Apayao are home to rice terraces.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>Many locals are also engaged in the manufacture of furniture, woven clothes, and handicraft.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <br>

			<h3>Poverty in Apayao</h3>
			<br>
			<h4>1. Poverty Threshold</h4>
			<p>The poverty threshold of the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) for the first semester of 2015 was estimated at PhP 11,017 per capita. Meaning, an individual needed a minimum monthly average income of PhP 1,836 to meet both basic food and non-food needs. This translates to a minimum of PhP9,181 minimum monthly take-home income for a family of five to be considered not poor.
          	</p><br>
			<h4>2. Food Threshold</h4>
		  <p>In the first semester of 2015, the estimated per capita food threshold in the Cordilleras was PhP 7,668. With this, an individual needed a minimum monthly average take-home pay of PhP 1,278 to meet basic food needs set by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI). For a family of five, they needed at least an average of PhP 6,390 monthly income.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>3. Poverty and Subsistence Incidence Among Population</h4>
		  <p>Poverty incidence among the population in CAR decreased by 2.0% points, from 28.7% in the first semester of 2012 to 26.7 percent in the first semester of 2015.&nbsp; </p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Among the provinces, Mt. Province had the highest poverty incidence with 49.9%, an increase of 4.6% in the first semester of 2012. <br>
              <br>
              The poor population in the province of Benguet also increased by 3.5% points, from 6.0% in the first semester of 2015. Even though poverty incidence increased, Benguet remained to be the least poor in the region.
              <br>
              <br>
              Apayao has the biggest decline in poverty incidence, from 63.0% in the first semester of 2012 down to 42.1% in the first semester of 2015, a difference of 20.9 percentage points. <br>
              <br>
              Meanwhile, the subsistence poor population of CAR also decreased, from 16.00% in the first semester of 2012 to 12.50% in the first semester of 2015.
			  
			  
			  However, Mt. Province and Benguet both increased in subsistence incidences while the other provinces decrease.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
			  <br>
			  The subsistence poor in Mountain Province increased by 4.7% points, from 20.0% in the first semester of 2012 to 24.7% in the first semester of 2015.
			  
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  Benguet had an additional 0.7% points to its food-poor population, from 1.4% in the first semester of 2012 to 2.1% in the first semester of 2015. Nevertheless, Benguet still managed to be the province with the least number of food-poor population.
              <br>
              <br>
          Apayao had the highest estimated subsistence incidence in the first semester of 2015 with 31.1% followed by Mt. Province with 24.7% and Ifugao with 21.7%.</p>
