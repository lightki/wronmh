			<h3>I. Geography</h3>		
			<p>Maguindanao is a province in the Philippines situated in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao occupying the Sulu Archipelago and the provinces of Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao in central Mindanao. Its capital is the Municipality of Shariff Aguak. <br>
		      <br>
	         The province has a land area of 9,968.31 square kilometers or 3,848.79 square miles. Its population as determined by the 2020 Census was 1,342,179. This represented 30.47% of the total population of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, 5.11% of the overall population of the Mindanao island group, or 1.23% of the entire population of the Philippines. Based on these figures, the population density is computed at 135 inhabitants per square kilometer or 349 inhabitants per square mile.</p>
			<br><br>

			<h3>II. Economy</h3>
			<p>The people of Maguindanao depend largely on agriculture for their livelihood. Farming rice and corn in addition to raising chickens are the main economic activities in the province.</p> 
			<br><br>

			<h3>Poverty in Maguindanao</h3>
			<p>IN THE nation’s third poorest province, Maguindanao, the poverty incidence is a staggering 62 percent – five of every six residents live on less than fifty pesos (or a US dollar) a day. And by all indications, every single sixth resident who is not poor could be an Ampatuan by blood or affinity. But in the midst of all that poverty, Maguindanao and the Ampatuans have always been awash in cash, not so much because of any economic activity of note, except for agriculture and occasional kidnap-for-ransom episodes in the area. <br>
			  <br>
		    The cash came nearly entirely from Manila, courtesy of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who has pampered the province and the clan as if they were her spoiled twins. In her nine years in power, President Arroyo has poured billions of pesos into the province in internal revenue allotment (IRA), public works budget, and other lump-sum funds. After all, she has nurtured a deep friendship with the Ampatuans, who delivered landslide victory margins for her and her senatorial candidates in the 2004 and 2007 elections. In fact, minutes after casting his ballot in the 2007 polls, Datu Zaldy Ampatuan, then governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), had with clairvoyant aplomb guaranteed a 12-0 victory for Arroyo’s senatorial slate.<br>
            <br>
            “Actually," he said, “Maguindanao province is an extension of the home province of Her Excellency, PGMA (President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo), which is Pampanga. Here in Maguindanao, considering that we have 20 mayors unopposed, these 20 mayors are allies of the administration, even those areas with opponents – Pagalungan and Talitay – the opponents are all allies of the administration" Arroyo’s lieutenants The Ampatuans were Arroyo’s anointed lieutenants in ARMM, their alliance built largely on largesse.<br>
            <br>
            To be fair, that was pretty much the same picture for two former ARMM governors: Zacaria Candao, who served during parts of the Aquino and Ramos administrations (1990 to 1993); and Nur Misuari, who served during the Ramos and Estrada regimes, but was more identified with the former. The cash bonanza that Maguindanao and ARMM secured from Arroyo, however, has failed dismally to alleviate the misery of the poor. Instead, its poverty numbers have grown parallel with the surge in the Ampatuans’ fortunes, a clan given to flaunting its wealth, weapons, and wheels. The irony is not lost on the likes of SocialWatch convenor and University of the Philippines professor Leonor Magtolis-Briones. <br>
            <br>
            According to the former national treasurer, “Magtatanong ka, saan napunta ang pera ng national government. Hindi mo naman nakikita sa sitwasyon ng tao, kulang ang mga duktor, kulang ang edukasyon, kulang ang tubig, hindi natatapos sa pag-aaral, tapos, nakikita mo ang mga bahay (ng Ampatuan) na malalaki (You’d ask, where did all that money from national government go? You don’t see it in the situation of the people, they need doctors, they are poorly schooled, they don’t have water, they don’t finish school, and yet the houses of the Ampatuans are so grand.)."</p>
